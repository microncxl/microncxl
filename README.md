# CMRK: CXL Memory Resource Kit

The CMRK is a collection of documentation, tools, and benchmarks for use with CXL memory.
It comprises both original content and CXL-related enhancements to external projects
that we plan to submit to upstream where appropriate.

Our goal is to expand the CMRK over time, in collaboration with the community, to help enable
applications to take full advantage of CXL memory.

## Getting Started

The `microncxl` repository is the top-level repo for the CMRK.  From there you can:

* Read the [documentation](https://github.com/microncxl/microncxl) to learn more about
CXL memory and the CMRK
* Ask a question, share ideas, or read announcements in the CMRK [discussions forum](https://github.com/microncxl/microncxl/discussions)
